Experimenting around to explore how radio waves transmit information.

<h3>2m Yagi Antenna</h3>
<p>I built this antenna to communicate with </br>
the International Space Station and locals in the </br>
radio society on NC State's campus. I measured out </br>
a driven element of nearly a half-wavelength (of appx 146 MHz), </br>
a reflector about a twentieth of a wavelenth longer </br>
and a director about a twentieth of a wavelength shorter. </br>
</br>
The antenna did not require any testing to originally work; </br>
although, I'm still in the process of adjusting its director </br>
and the power supplied from my transciever for a conversation of the ISS. </br>
